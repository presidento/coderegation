SOLID is a collection of five common object-oriented development principles collected into one handy acronym. Smart people recommend learning about it, and even the name sounds fantastic â€” who doesn't want to write "solid" code?

Good object-oriented design is indeed helpful, but SOLID as a set of guiding principles really isn't. Let's break SOLID down and reveal the limitations of our current approach, and try to understand just how SOLID our code needs to be.
